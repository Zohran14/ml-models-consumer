              Safe Kids monitors student use of School-Assigned Devices, uses
              artificial intelligence to identify Problematic Internet Use and
              Problematic Messaging and intervenes (programmatically) to
              discourage Problematic Internet Use and Problematic Messaging
              where it determines there may be such Use or Messaging (the “
              <strong>Services</strong>”). For Safe Kids to provide the Services
              on a School Assigned Device assigned to you or your minor child,
              the Downloadable Software must be downloaded on that School
              Assigned Device. You agree to these Terms when you permit the
              School to download the Downloadable Software on the School
              Assigned Device assigned to you or your minor child.
            </p>
            <p>For purposes of these Terms:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The term “Problematic Internet Use” refers to a range of
                repetitive impairing behaviors, such as excessive video gaming,
                cybersex, online buying, gambling, streaming, social media use,
                online messaging including emails, chats, google or Microsoft
                documents or similar, online searching for health-related
                information and inability to control the amount of time spent
                interfacing with digital technology.
              </li>
              <li>
                The term “School” refers to an academic institution that is
                acquiring the SafeKids Services and that you, or your minor
                child, attend, but only if the school has provided you, or your
                minor child (whichever is the student), a School-Assigned Device
                and you have consented to the implementation of the SafeKids
                Services with respect to such School-Assigned Device; and
              </li>
              <li>
                The term “School-Assigned Device” refers to a desktop, laptop,
                and mobile device such as a tablet, a smart phone, an e-reader,
                or a virtual or augmented reality device on which the School has
                implemented SafeKids Downloadable Software and that is assigned
                by such School to you or your minor child, whichever is the
                student at the School.
              </li>
              <li>
                The term “SafeKids Downloadable Software” refers to downloadable
                tools or other software that SafeKids makes available for
                download specifically for purposes of facilitating access to,
                operation of, or use of the SafeKids Services, and any
                enhancements SafeKids may make available to such Software from
                time-to-time.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The provision of the Services with respect to the School Assigned
              Device assigned to you or your minor child is conditioned upon
              your agreement as set forth herein.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have reviewed the Video Demonstration and the Safe Kids LLC
              Privacy Policy and consent to the implementation of the
              Downloadable Software on the School Assigned Device assigned to me
              or my minor child and the use of such Software and the related
              Services described in the Video Demonstration in connection with
              my or my minor child’s use of such Device. I recognize that the
              Software and related Services will be monitoring my or my minor
              child’s use of the School Assigned Device at and outside school
              including when used from home on a home wi-fi network or a
              cellular network.
            </p>
            <p>
              I acknowledge and understand that there is no guarantee that the
              Software or related Services will be available and functioning at
              the time my child attempts to use the Device, that the Software or
              Services will identify all uses that may be signs of Problematic
              Internet Use, or that the programmatic intervention will have the
              effect of discouraging such Use.
            </p>
            <p>
              I acknowledge and understand that in some circumstances mitigating
              the impact of Problematic Internet Use may not be possible, and
              where it is possible mitigation is likely to result from some
              combination of the following factors, including among others:
              parental input, input from other family members, input from
              friends, input from other community sources and input from other
              technology-based tools as well as from the Services.
            </p>
            <p>
              I acknowledge and agree that Safe Kids, the company that developed
              the Services and made it available to the School, shall have no
              liability of any kind arising from or associated with my child’s
              Problematic Internet Use, the failure of the Services to operate,
              or the operation of the Services including any programmatic
              intervention that may take place, and specifically waives any
              rights or claim it may have against Safe Kids arising in
              connection with my child’s use of the School Assigned Device and
              the impact or lack thereof of the Services.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>
                I acknowledge that the programmatic intervention by the solution
                may include the provision of a notice to School-designated
                personnel (including administrator, counselors and teachers)
                that my child has engaged in Problematic Internet Use after my
                child has ignored multiple solution generated warnings;
                provided, however, that in the case of Problematic Internet Use
                that reasonably can be understood to give rise to a risk of
                self-harm or violence against others (including the intent to
                acquire or use a weapon), the solution may give such notice
                before or simultaneous with the solution generated warnings
                provided my child. For clarity, such notice will identify my
                child, describe the Problematic Internet Use, list sites visited
                by my child, and include copies of emails and chats sent or
                received and documents drafted. Moreover, upon receipt of such
                notice the School may share such notice or otherwise disclose
                the Problematic Internet Use to law enforcement.
              </em>

              I acknowledge that I have reviewed, understand and agree to Safe
              Kids’ Privacy Policy https://www.safekids.ai/privacy-policy. I
              understand that if my child is under the age of 13, the Children’s
              Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) requires Safe Kids to
              provide parental notification and obtain parental consent before
              collecting personal information from my child or my child’s
              computer. I understand that the Software collects information from
              the School Assigned Device used by my child, and consent to such
              collection.
