                    <p>Last modified: June 20<sup>th</sup>, 2022</p>
                    <p>Safe Kids monitors student use of School-Assigned Devices, uses artificial intelligence to
                        identify
                        Problematic Internet Use and Problematic Messaging and intervenes (programmatically) to
                        discourage
                        Problematic Internet Use and Problematic Messaging where it determines there may be such Use or
                        Messaging (the “<strong>Services</strong>”). For Safe Kids to provide the Services on a School
                        Assigned Device assigned to you or your minor child, the Downloadable Software must be
                        downloaded on
                        that School Assigned Device. You agree to these Terms when you permit the School to download the
                        Downloadable Software on the School Assigned Device assigned to you or your minor child.</p>
                    <p>For purposes of these Terms:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The term “Problematic Internet Use” refers to a range of repetitive impairing behaviors,
                            such as
                            excessive video gaming, cybersex, online buying, gambling, streaming, social media use,
                            online
                            messaging including emails, chats, google or Microsoft documents or similar, online
                            searching
                            for health-related information and inability to control the amount of time spent interfacing
                            with digital technology.</li>
                        <li>The term “School” refers to an academic institution that is acquiring the SafeKids Services
                            and
                            that you, or your minor child, attend, but only if the school has provided you, or your
                            minor
                            child (whichever is the student), a School-Assigned Device and you have consented to the
                            implementation of the SafeKids Services with respect to such School-Assigned Device; and
                        </li>
                        <li>The term “School-Assigned Device” refers to a desktop, laptop, and mobile device such as a
                            tablet, a smart phone, an e-reader, or a virtual or augmented reality device on which the
                            School
                            has implemented SafeKids Downloadable Software and that is assigned by such School to you or
                            your minor child, whichever is the student at the School.</li>
                        <li>The term “SafeKids Downloadable Software” refers to downloadable tools or other software
                            that
                            SafeKids makes available for download specifically for purposes of facilitating access to,
                            operation of, or use of the SafeKids Services, and any enhancements SafeKids may make
                            available
                            to such Software from time-to-time.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The provision of the Services with respect to the School Assigned Device assigned to you or your
                        minor child is conditioned upon your agreement as set forth herein.</p>
                    <p>I have reviewed the Video Demonstration and the Safe Kids LLC Privacy Policy and consent to the
                        implementation of the Downloadable Software on the School Assigned Device assigned to me or my
                        minor
                        child and the use of such Software and the related Services described in the Video Demonstration
                        in
                        connection with my or my minor child&#8217;s use of such Device. I recognize that the Software
                        and
                        related Services will be monitoring my or my minor child&#8217;s use of the School Assigned
                        Device
                        at and outside school including when used from home on a home wi-fi network or a cellular
                        network.
                    </p>
                    <p>I acknowledge and understand that there is no guarantee that the Software or related Services
                        will be
                        available and functioning at the time my child attempts to use the Device, that the Software or
                        Services will identify all uses that may be signs of Problematic Internet Use, or that the
                        programmatic intervention will have the effect of discouraging such Use.</p>
                    <p>I acknowledge and understand that in some circumstances mitigating the impact of Problematic
                        Internet
                        Use may not be possible, and where it is possible mitigation is likely to result from some
                        combination of the following factors, including among others: parental input, input from other
                        family members, input from friends, input from other community sources and input from other
                        technology-based tools as well as from the Services.</p>
                    <p>I acknowledge and agree that Safe Kids, the company that developed the Services and made it
                        available
                        to the School, shall have no liability of any kind arising from or associated with my
                        child&#8217;s
                        Problematic Internet Use, the failure of the Services to operate, or the operation of the
                        Services
                        including any programmatic intervention that may take place, and specifically waives any rights
                        or
                        claim it may have against Safe Kids arising in connection with my child&#8217;s use of the
                        School
                        Assigned Device and the impact or lack thereof of the Services.</p>
                    <p><em>I acknowledge that the programmatic intervention by the solution may include the provision of
                            a
                            notice to School-designated personnel (including administrator, counselors and teachers)
                            that my
                            child has engaged in Problematic Internet Use after my child has ignored multiple solution
                            generated warnings; provided, however, that in the case of Problematic Internet Use that
                            reasonably can be understood to give rise to a risk of self-harm or violence against others
                            (including the intent to acquire or use a weapon), the solution may give such notice before
                            or
                            simultaneous with the solution generated warnings provided my child. For clarity, such
                            notice
                            will identify my child, describe the Problematic Internet Use, list sites visited by my
                            child,
                            and include copies of emails and chats sent or received and documents drafted. Moreover,
                            upon
                            receipt of such notice the School may share such notice or otherwise disclose the
                            Problematic
                            Internet Use to law enforcement.</em></p>
                    <p>I acknowledge that I have reviewed, understand and agree to Safe Kids’ Privacy Policy
                        https://www.safekids.ai/privacy-policy. I understand that if my child is under the age of 13,
                        the
                        Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) requires Safe Kids to provide parental
                        notification
                        and obtain parental consent before collecting personal information from my child or my child’s
                        computer. I understand that the Software collects information from the School Assigned Device
                        used
                        by my child, and consent to such collection.</p>
