                            the Indemnitor&#8217;s sole cost and expense. The Indemnitor shall promptly assume control
                            of
                            the defense and shall employ counsel of its choice to handle and defend the same, at the
                            Indemnitor&#8217;s sole cost and expense. The Indemnitee may participate in and observe the
                            proceedings at its own cost and expense with counsel of its own choosing. The Indemnitor
                            shall
                            not settle any claim on any terms or in any manner that adversely affects the rights of any

                            unreasonably
                            withheld or delayed. If the Indemnitor fails or refuses to assume control of the defense of
                            such
                            claim, the Indemnitee shall have the right, but no obligation, to defend against such claim,
                            including settling such claim after giving notice to the Indemnitor, in each case in such
                            manner
                            and on such terms as the Indemnitee may deem appropriate. The Indemnitee&#8217;s failure to
                            perform any obligations under this Section 12.3 will not relieve the Indemnitor of its
                            obligations under this Section 12, except to the extent that the Indemnitor can demonstrate
                            that

                            promotional materials, presentations, web site, and proposals to current and prospective
                            clients

                            perform its obligations, to the extent that the failure is caused by Client’s lack of
                            cooperation. Safe Kids may rely upon the accuracy and completeness of data, material, and
                            other
